Problems

    - Not using Async I/O (java.nio.channels.AsynchronousFileChannel)
    - DELETE ENH not using leases
    - Not synchronizing databases across Peers
    - DELETE ENH delete -> backup -> old delete deletes new backup if same file
    - RESTORE ENH multiple peers same file won't work, needs destination Peer on message
    - Could backup keystore between Peers
    - Same peer/protocol/file isn't prevented, crashes
    - Database isn't backed up and fault tolerant
