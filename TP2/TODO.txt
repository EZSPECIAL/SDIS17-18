    - DELETE ENH version mismatch
    - HMAC for message authentication / validation
    - encrypt / decrypt message with AES-256
    - hash / salt keystore password
    - Check all Thread.sleep() in code and see if they make sense
    - restore even without original file (add file metadata to DB / RETRIEVE message)
    - every protocol playing nice with each other (prevent same peer same protocol same file)
    - DB backup between peers (filename as fileID)
    - keystore backup?

Problems

    - Not using Async I/O (java.nio.channels.AsynchronousFileChannel)
    - DELETE ENH not using leases
    - Not synchronizing databases across Peers
    - DELETE ENH delete -> backup -> old delete deletes new backup if same file
    - RESTORE ENH multiple peers same file won't work, needs destination Peer on message
