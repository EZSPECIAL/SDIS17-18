    - RESTORE ENH find port
    - RESTORE ENH different version test
    - RESTORE ENH same peer multiple files
    - DELETE ENH version mismatch

---------------------
SECURITY
---------------------

    - HMAC for message authentication / validation
    - encrypt / decrypt message with AES-256

---------------------
SCALABILITY
---------------------

    - Async I/O (java.nio.channels.AsynchronousFileChannel)
    - Check all Thread.sleep() in code and see if they make sense

---------------------
FAULT-TOLERANCE
---------------------

    - restore even without original file (add file metadata to DB / RETRIEVE message / force restore only on initiators?)

---------------------
EXTRAS
---------------------

    - synchronize databases across Peers
    - every protocol playing nice with each other (prevent same peer same protocol same file)
    - DELETE ENH delete -> backup -> old delete deletes new backup if same file
    - RESTORE ENH multiple peers same file
    - DELETE lease?
    - DB backup between peers (fileid?)
