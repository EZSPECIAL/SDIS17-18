File structure from SVN must be maintained for optimal program functionality. The Peers create a personal
storage area one level up from the "src" folder, restored files are saved in a "Restored" folder
also one level up from the "src" folder. This also applies to text logs created automatically.

Compiling is done by running the "CompileAndRMI.sh" script which also starts the RMI Registry.

The system runs according to the handout with 2 new optional options for logging purposes, each
logging level prints all the logs from the lower levels. Levels are in a left to right fashion in
terms of value, DEBUG is recommended for checking system performance. The log method is best
left on CONSOLE, the level of threads running and logging to file sometimes caused problems but
doesn't seem to affect system operation.

java StartPeer <version> <id> <accessPoint> <mcc> <mdb> <mdr> [<logLevel> <logMethod>]

version     - 1.0 or 1.1
id          - non zero positive
accesspoint - remote object name (must be local in "name" format)
mcc         - IP:port of multicast control channel
mdb         - IP:port of multicast data backup channel
mdr         - IP:port of multicast data restore channel
logLevel    - NONE, NORMAL, SERVICE_MSG, DEBUG, DATABASE, VERBOSE
logMethod   - CONSOLE, FILE, BOTH

The test app also runs according to the handout and must be run locally with the Peer
intended to be the initiator Peer.

java TestApp <accessPoint> <protocol> <opnd1> <opnd2>

accessPoint - remote object name (must be local in "name" format)
protocol    - BACKUP, RESTORE, DELETE, RECLAIM, STATE
opnd1       - pathname, max KB if RECLAIM, STATE has no operands
opnd2       - repDeg if BACKUP

Apart from these options there are also some convenience scripts for testing, which are:
    - Peer1.sh, Peer2.sh, Peer3.sh and Peer4.sh run Peers with different logging levels, the access point is the same as the script, e.g. "Peer1"
    - an assortment of TestApp calling scripts to test the Peers

These scripts rely on the test files provided in the repository and the file structure therein.
