accessPoint - remote object name

opnd1       - pathname, max KB if RECLAIM, STATE has no operands
opnd2       - repDeg if BACKUP

id          - non zero positive
accesspoint - remote object name
mcc         - IP:port of multicast control channel

PEER
---------------------

    - identified by ID (1 to INT_MAX)
    - has a local folder that serves as their virtual HDD

SERVICE MESSAGE
---------------------

    - header / body (data)
    - 1+ space between fields
    - 0+ spaces on last field
    - header termination <CRLF><CRLF>
    - new/modified messages can have more header fields, ignore them in parser
    - drop any unrecognized message

    - message type (protocol)
    - version ("1.0")
    - senderID (peer id)
    - fileID (sha256 with last modified metadata, encoded as HEX to ASCII)
    - chunkNo (start at 0, up to 6 digits)
    - repDegree (1 to 9, store N copies in system)

    - body (file divided in 64K chunks identified by (fileID, chunkNo), last chunk has 0 to 63999 size)

PROTOCOLS
---------------------

Backup

    Initiator
    - MDB -> PUTCHUNK <Version> <SenderId> <FileId> <ChunkNo> <ReplicationDeg> <CRLF><CRLF><Body>
    - a Peer must never store the chunks of its own files
    - 1 sec to receive repDegree STORED else resends -> double the interval up to 5 times
    - STORED must come from different Peers

    Peers
    - MC -> STORED <Version> <SenderId> <FileId> <ChunkNo> <CRLF><CRLF>
    - random delay between 0 and 400ms

Delete

    Initiator
    - MC -> DELETE <Version> <SenderId> <FileId> <CRLF><CRLF>
    - all peers delete their chunks of the file
    - send N times to ensure reception of message

---------------------
THREADING
---------------------

Version 1

    - one protocol instance at a time
    - one thread for each peer

Version 2

    - one protocol instance at a time
    - one thread per channel (control, backup, restore)
    - msg thread is endless loop of receive -> process
    - multicaster thread (thread.sleep() for timeout), created for TestApp, terminated on protocol finish
    - TestApp RMI creates multicaster thread to handle protocol invoked

Version 3

    - multiple multicaster instances on any Peer, handle 1 protocol
    - one thread per channel
    - java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap to store protocol state instances

Version 4

    - receiver threads now use worker threads for processing so that they can keep listening
    - java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor
